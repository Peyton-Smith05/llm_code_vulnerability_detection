# LLM Code Vulnerability Detection
This repository contains research done to try to utilize Large Language Models to detect and correct vulnerabilities in code. The `lava` directory contains information and code on how I extracted data for a conversational AI using the [LAVA](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7546498) tool. The `juliet` directory contains information on how I extracted similar data from the [Juliet Dataset](https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-suites/112). The `llama2` directory contains information on how I downloaded and queried the [LLaMA 2 13b parameter](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/llama-2-open-foundation-and-fine-tuned-chat-models/) model locally. The `extra` directory has more information on various other turorials and code written to download and finetune LLMs.
