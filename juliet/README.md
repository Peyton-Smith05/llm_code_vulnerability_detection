# Juliet Dataset

### File Structure

The `juliet` directory contains the python script for extracting the juliet dataset into a format that can be used by an LLM for querying. The `juliet/data` directory contains the csv files I parsed and used to query the model. The `juliet/juliet_dataset` is the downloaded dataset containing all test cases.

### Code

The following directory contains the downloaded [Juliet Dataset](https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-suites/112) and a script to extract data from the dataset that can be used to query a LLM with or potentially finetune an LLM with. 

* In a python virtual environment, install pandas.

* Run `python3 extract_juliet.py` 

This script iterates through each file and finds the good and bad function within the file then saves them along with the CWE number, file path, and bug label.
